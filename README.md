# DS1216-Smartwatch-Real-Time-Clock-For-Arduino
Example code to have an Arduino read and set the date and time on a Dallas Semiconductor DS1216 / DS1315 real time clock (Smartwatch) chip.
This only requires 4 wires between the Arduino and the clock chip.
The DS1216 has an internal lithium battery so the time only needs to be set once.

Project includes a photo showing connections to Arduino and example output from the program.
Project files including photos and source code are free for use without restriction. Credit is welcome.
